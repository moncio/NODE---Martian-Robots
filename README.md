# NODE---Martian-Robots

This repository contains an app created with Nodejs to simulate a robot moving in the surface of Mars.

## Explanation

### ðŸ”¶ Requirements

âœ… Robot turns left when receives "L" instruction.
âœ… Robot turns right when receives "R" instruction.
âœ… Robot moves forward when receives "F" instruction.
âœ… The output indicates the final grid position and orientation of the robot.
âœ… The robot has to move inside the control are of the bounds grid, otherwise the app will print "LOST" in the output.

### ðŸ”¶  Methodology

To do this exercise, I used TDD methodology in order to produce the solution, following the next steps:
- Write the test.
- Write the production code.
- Refactor.

## ðŸš€ How to run the Apps

You need to have either [```Node```](https://nodejs.org/es/) or [```Docker```](https://www.docker.com/) previously installed in your computer.

In case you are using **node** directly, you only need to run the following command in order to install the necesary dependencies (Jest).
```
npm install
```

Once installed them, you need to introduce the next command in your terminal to run the tests:
```
npm test
```

To make easier the execution of each solution, everything has been packaged using **docker** and **docker-compose**, so it is required to have this software installed for it.

The following command builds the container:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

Once built, the next one executes the container:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```
